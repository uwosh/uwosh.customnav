Custom Navigation Builder allows you to create dropdown menus by simply adding folders and links to the 'Custom Navigation Folder'.

 
To Create a Dropdown Tab
---------------------

-Simply place a folder in the root of the Custom Navigation Folder

NOTE: Other object types placed in the root of the Custom Navigation Folder will be ignored


To Add Items to Your Dropdown Tab
-----------------------------

-Simply place a folder or link within the folder you made to represent your dropdown tab

-Folders will be rendered as headers and will link to the folder itself and are used as a way to structure your dropdown

-Links will render as links to the link's defined URL

-Within folders as many layers of folders and links as you want can be embedded

-For organizational purposes it is best to place folders on level 2 of the Custom Navigation Folder(CNF) and links on level 3 of the CNF within the appropriate header

NOTE: Other object types placed in any subfolder will be ignored


Link the Dropdown Tab to a Page
--------------------------
-Add the the url of where the dropdown tab is supposed to link to within the following tag <tablink></tablink> in the description section of the folder representing the dropdown tab

Example: <tablink>http://www.uwosh.edu/plone</tablink>

 
To Finalize Your Dropdown Tabs with Items
----------------------------------

-Simply click on the 'Create Dropdown' button in the actions dropdown in upper right corner of the Custom Navigation Folder

NOTE: For any changes to the Custom Navigation Folder to take affect, you must click the 'Create Dropdown' button in the actions button within the Custom Navigation Folder
